# IUST Computer Workshop Lectures

This is a compilation of the lecture notes and homework I created and designed for a Computer workshop course at IUST. I was responsible for teaching the students on vital tools they need as a Computer Engineering student.

## Compilation
It is recommended that you use `xelatex` to compile the TeX files.
